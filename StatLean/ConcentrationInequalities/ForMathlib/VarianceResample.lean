# Variance as a half-averaged squared difference of two independent copies

For a probability measure $\nu$ and a square-integrable $g$,
$$ \operatorname{Var}(g) \;=\; \tfrac12 \int\!\!\int \bigl(g(a) - g(b)\bigr)^2
   \, d\nu(a)\, d\nu(b), $$
the elementary identity $\operatorname{Var}(X) = \tfrac12 \mathbb{E}\,(X - Y)^2$ for
independent identically distributed $X, Y$, written directly as an iterated integral so
that no auxiliary product space is needed. Absent from Mathlib at our pin (verified by
search for `variance_eq_half`, `integrable_sq` and the `IdentDistrib` API in
`Mathlib/Probability/Moments/Variance.lean`); Mathlib-only imports — candidate upstream.

This is the brick that converts the leave-one-out conditional variance
$\operatorname{Var}^{(i)}(Z)$ of the Efron–Stein bound into its resampled form
$\tfrac12\,\mathbb{E}\,(Z - Z_i')^2$. It supplies the iid-copy variance identity; the
product-law interpretation of the replacement coordinate is supplied by `PiUpdate`.

**Reference.** Stéphane Boucheron, Gábor Lugosi and Pascal Massart, *Concentration
Inequalities: A Nonasymptotic Theory of Independence*, Oxford University Press, 2013
(ISBN 978-0-19-953525-5), §3.1, p. 55. Inside the proof of Theorem 3.1, the book
conditionally applies the elementary iid-copy identity
$\operatorname{Var}(X) = \tfrac12\mathbb{E}[(X-Y)^2]$.

**Proof formalization notes.** Pure expansion: center by $m = \nu[g]$, write
$(g(a) - g(b))^2 = (g(a) - m)^2 - 2 (g(a) - m)(g(b) - m) + (g(b) - m)^2$, and integrate in
$b$ first — the cross term vanishes because $\int (g - m)\, d\nu = 0$. Integrability of
every piece comes from `MemLp.integrable one_le_two` and `MemLp.integrable_sq` against the
finite measure. `variance_eq_integral` supplies the centered form of the variance.

**Bibliographic comments.** The identity is folklore: it is the $U$-statistic
representation of the variance. Boucheron–Lugosi–Massart state it without attribution as
an "elementary fact", and no attribution is asserted here beyond that.
